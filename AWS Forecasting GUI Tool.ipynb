    "### Understanding the Forecast\n",
    "> At a first glance, the visual representation of the forecast is not simple to understand because there is not any explanation of what **P10**, **P50**, and **P90** mean. After looking through the documentation, here is what I found: \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**wQuantileLoss[0.1]**: For the P10 prediction, the true value is expected to be lower than the predicted value 10% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose that you're a retailer and you want to forecast product demand for winter gloves that sell well only during the fall and winter. If you don't have a lot of storage space and the cost of invested capital is high, or if the price of being overstocked on winter gloves concerns you, you might use the P10 quantile to order a relatively low number of winter gloves. You know that the P10 forecast overestimates the demand for your winter gloves only 10% of the time, so 90% of the time you'll be sold out of your winter gloves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**wQuantileLoss[0.5]**: For the P50 prediction, the true value is expected to be lower than the predicted value 50% of the time. In most cases, the point forecasts that you generate internally or with other forecasting tools should match the P50 forecasts. If τ = 0.5, both weights are equal and the wQuantileLoss[0.5] reduces to the commonly used Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where ŷi,t = qi,t(0.5).\n",
    "\n",
    "Forecast uses the scaling factor of 2 in the wQuantileLoss formula to cancel the 0.5 factor to obtain the exact MAPE expression.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuing the winter gloves example, if you know that there'll be a moderate amount of demand for the gloves and aren't concerned about being overstocked, you might choose to use the P50 quantile to order gloves.\n",
    "\n",
    "**wQuantileLoss[0.9]**: For the P90 prediction, the true value is expected to be lower than the predicted value 90% of the time.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you determine that being understocked on gloves will result in huge amounts of lost revenue—for example, the cost of not selling gloves is extremely high or the cost of invested capital is low—you might choose to use the P90 quantile to order gloves.\n",
    "\n",
